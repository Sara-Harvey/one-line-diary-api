# README
The front end files are included in this repo, and are also here: https://github.com/Sara-Harvey/one-line-diary-frontend.


The One-Line Diary is super minimal blogging app that lets users call entries by category, and browse the records for several days at a glance.

Back end The app fetches data from the API at 'http://localhost:3000/entries'.

Front end The app uses JavaScript to asynchronously make GET and POST requests to the API, to populate the page with data and to update the API. The data and functionality of the front end was encapsulated in classes and methods.

To use this app:

Clone the repository git clone git@github.com:Sara-Harvey/one-line-diary-js.git

Navigate into the 'one-line-diary-backend' directory cd one-line-diary-backend

Install the required gem dependencies and start the server bundle install Rails S

Double click "index.html" in the frontend folder, and enjoy!
